# Solar System Simulation

A simulation of the solar system up to the first four planets using Java Swing. Some scaling had to be done to ensure the planets could fit reasonably within the screen, and for the moon's orbit around the Earth to be clearly visible. The times (in years and days) shown are relative to each planet.
